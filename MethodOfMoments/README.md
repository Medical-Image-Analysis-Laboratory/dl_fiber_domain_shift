# Diffusion MRI Data Harmonization via Method of Moments (MoM)

This folder contains our implementation of the Method of Moments (MoM) for harmonizing diffusion MRI data across different sites. The method is described in the following paper:
- K. M. Huynh, G. Chen, Y. Wu, D. Shen, and P.-T. Yap, "Multi-Site Harmonization of Diffusion MRI Data via Method of Moments," IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 38, no. 7, pp. 1599â€“1609, Jul. 2019, doi: 10.1109/TMI.2019.2895020.

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE images: [Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE Images](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image)

## Structure

- `harmonization.m`: The main script for harmonizing diffusion MRI data via MoM.
