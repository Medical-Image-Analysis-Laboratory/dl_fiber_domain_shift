# Robust Estimation of the Microstructure of the Early Developing Brain Using Deep Learning

This folder contains our implementation of the deep learning model for white matter fiber estimation in newborn and baby brains. The model is described in the following paper:
- H. Kebiri, A. Gholipour, R. Lin, L. Vasung, D. Karimi, and M. Bach Cuadra, "Robust Estimation of the Microstructure of the Early Developing Brain Using Deep Learning," in 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention -- MICCAI 2023, Oct. 2023, pp. 293â€“303, doi: 10.1007/978-3-031-43990-2_28.
